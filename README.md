# The online dating manifesto

## Introduction

Lets be honest online dating is a total S*** show!

There are [plenty of links to the total mess.](https://raindrop.io/cubicgarden/dating-and-intimacy-worries-47875973)

Following several discussions and back-and-forths over time with many different people.
It was Julia in a coffee shop in Amsterdam central station who suggested a manifesto.

I found Julia’s thought process incredible and I wrote a book about my experiences with dating; I have quoted Julia in the Epigraph…

> 'If we increasingly live within the mere margins of algorithms, then what does it mean to be human?'

This get's right into the crux of the problem of online dating and its wider effects on personal wellbeing, relationships and society as a whole.


## The manifesto outline

Leaning on the [W3C's ethical web](https://www.w3.org/TR/ethical-web-principles/) and [MyData priciples](https://mydata.org/about/purposes-principles/)  

We have an outline of...

* Personal control of algorithms through transparency
* Ownership and portability of personal profiles
* Dark patterns, gamification, ludic loops and enshittifcation should not be used in dating services
* No more grass is greener and tempting tricks
* No more hiring non-genuine daters to fill your dating service
* The mental health of daters must take priority over profit
* Dating systems must not cause harm to society
* Dating systems should encourage healthy freedom of expression 
* Dating system must not prescribe a singular way to date and match
* Dating systems for everyone
* Clear rules over GenAI use and collection of data
* Attractiveness is not global
* End the Privatisation of Intimacy
